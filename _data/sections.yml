      title: La Mer
      description: This vibrant beachfront entertainment area continues to grow in size and sparkle. Fantastic views of the Dubai skyline contrast against the DIY aesthetic of the place, an urban playground with a focus on sustainability. Families are well served with the Hawa Hawa trampoline park and the Laguna Waterpark, with plenty of lounges and restaurants for the adults. La Mer is a colourful spot with street art and atmosphere by the bucket-load.

      title: "For purists: Black Palace Beach"
      description: Fewer frills, more beach. Whether you want to kick-back and count the waves that roll up the beach, flip open your holiday read, or look at the palm island of Jumeirah and the Burj Al Arab in the distance, you’ll find peace at Black Palace Beach. This hidden beach, rather remarkably for Dubai, is also void of any facilities. No lounges, restaurants or the like; so bring a picnic and enjoy a rather rare slice of tranquillity in this sunny metropolis.

      title: "For sun-worshippers: Sunset Beach"
      description: The place for unforgettable sundowners is Sunset Beach, also known as Umm Suqeim Beach. In the shadow of the Burj Al Arab, the beach is perfect for that iconic sunset photo-op, after a day of basking in the sunshine and crystal-clear waters. Not without its quirks, Sunset Beach also has a book library for a last-minute holiday read and is one of the few places in Dubai where night swimming is allowed (until midnight).

      description: "Its name is telling: Kite Beach is a nirvana for outdoor fanatics. Kite surfing, stand-up paddleboarding, kayaking; Kite Beach is a one-stop-shop for all of this, especially when the wind picks up in the afternoon. Grab some mates and play some beach volleyball, or take advantage of the 14km jogging route. Catch the skaters throwing tricks in the largest skate park in the United Arab Emirates and, after so much action, head to the Salt Café to crown your beach day with a juicy burger."

      title: Al Fahidi & Al Seef
      description: The greatest alternative to Dubai's soaring skyscrapers is the historic Al Fahidi District in Bur Dubai. Thanks to its strategic location on Dubai Creek, Al Fahidi was an important neighbourhood, with beautiful and traditional wind-tower-houses peering over narrow streets. The redesigned Al Seef follows nearby, where tradition and modernity merge. Visit the floating market with regional handicrafts and stock up with designers from Arabia and the rest of the world.

      title: Traditional souks
      description: "A classic Arabian experience awaits you in the heart of the Emirate: the souks. Feeling fancy? Head down to the Deira Gold Souk. This dazzling marketplace is filled with a breathtaking array of intricate gold jewellery, all ready to be haggled for: be sure to check the gold price for the day! Take home a flavour of the city with a dip into the spice souk, where technicolour piles of exotic powders fill the air with irresistible fragrances. Speaking of which, don’t miss the perfume souk, where incense and essential oils mingle with the heavy scent of the perfumes. Combine your latest fragrance with silk from the textile souk and live like royalty."

      description: "What was life in Dubai like before the merger of the seven emirates? The Etihad Museum provides the answer. The main focus of the museum is on the years between 1968 and 1974, when this remarkable country gained its independence – interactive displays and a wealth of artefacts mark the milestones of the formation of UAE. The building itself is also significant: the striking curved roof is the work of Canadian architects Moriyama & Teshima."

      title: Dubai Frame
      description: One of the more peculiar of Dubai’s futuristic projects, the Dubai Frame quite literally frames the city skyline within its towering edges. Head to Zabeel Park to gaze up at this 150m-high marvel. Even more spectacular is the inside; start at the bottom where a small exhibit looks at the city’s past, then head right to the top for dizzying views of Dubai’s present. With rather exhilarating glass-floor sections to waltz over, a descent is much welcome. At the bottom, the tour finishes with a look at Dubai’s future.

      title: Burj Khalifa, Fountains & Opera
      description: Dubai's iconic landmark stretches 828 metres into the Arabian sky, a dizzying feat of engineering that offers unrivalled views from the top. Right next door is the Dubai Fountain. Shooting columns of water 150m high, it’s another superlative – one of the largest fountains in the world. In front of the Dubai Mall, thundering jets of water erupt every 30 minutes. The neighboring Dubai Opera completes this plaza of grandiose entertaining, with a diverse program of operas, musicals, concerts and more.

      title: Dubai Creek, Water Canal
      description: The Dubai Creek is still the lifeline of this vibrant desert city. Wooden transport ships, so-called dhows, still bring goods from neighboring countries. Abras, small water taxis, transport residents between the Bur Dubai and Deira districts. It’s all about lifestyle; hotels and lounges, lengthy pedestrian walkways and parks are being built on the banks of the newly created Business Bay Canal and the 3.2 km long Water Canal. The intersection of the Water Canal and Sheikh Zayed Road is marked by an illuminated waterfall; the effect is clear; Dubai, the once desert-outpost, wants for nothing.

      title: Museum of the Future
      description: So futuristic it’s not even open yet, the Museum of the Future is rumoured to be the next iconic and ambitious landmark for the city. Set to open this year, it already has plenty of people talking, with its incredible design.  Its fittingly futuristic shape resembles an ellipse, partly inspired by the DNA double helix and only possible with the very latest engineering technologies. And the inside? Instead of exhibiting cultural artefacts of time gone by, the museum looks firmly into the future with pertinent questions about robots, artificial intelligence, and the relationship between man and machine.

Be it a day trip or a longer break from the city, Hatta impresses with natural beauty and cultural sites that are best explored by bike, on the back of a camel or whilst hiking. There are several options for staying overnight between 4-star hotels or glamping, allowing enough time to divert into the mountains for a wild getaway. Whatever you do, don’t miss the star-studded night sky.

Conquer the sand dunes in an off-road vehicle – a vintage Land Rover is our favourite – and be sure to add a traditional Emirati breakfast or nighttime astronomy tour to your daring outing. Meet the Arabian Oryx as you spill over the dunes. Looking for more adrenaline? Hit the dunes on a self-drive quad bike, or practice your sandboarding on these golden waves...

You could spend your whole holiday slipping from slide to slide, fixing your adrenaline needs one splash at a time. Starting at the Aquaventure Waterpark, Dubai’s biggest with thrilling world-class rides, through the Wild Wadi Waterpark, the original Dubai waterpark since 1999, to the weird and wonderful floating obstacle-course of AquaFun. For something a little more refined, head to the new beach district of La Mer and visit Laguna Waterpark.

It covers an area of ​​200 football fields and with over 1,200 shops and hundreds of places to eat and drink. Gucci & Valentino are waiting for you on Fashion Avenue, sharks and rays slink around the Dubai Aquarium, and steak with truffles await in Gallery Lafayette. The new stylish promenade The Pointe on Palm Jumeirah Island feels a little less overwhelming.
